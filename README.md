#  WordPress Docker Compose


## Installation

Open a terminal and `cd` to the folder in which `docker-compose.yml` is saved and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

This creates two new folders next to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

* `wp-data` – used to store and restore database dumps
* `wp-app` – the location of your WordPress application

The containers are now built and running. You should be able to access the WordPress installation with the configured IP in the browser address. By default it is `http://127.0.0.1`.

For convenience you may add a new entry into your hosts file.

## Usage

### Starting containers

You can start the containers with the `up` command in daemon mode (by adding `-d` as an argument) or by using the `start` command:

```
docker-compose start
```

### Stopping containers

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Removing containers

To stop and remove all the containers use the`down` command:

```
docker-compose down
```

Use `-v` if you need to remove the database volume which is used to persist the database:

```
docker-compose down -v


### Creating database dumps

```
./export.sh
```
